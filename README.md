# Vanilla JS Elevators

### An exercise for Arbox

A simplistic simulation of a building with user given amount of floors and elevators.
The user can press a button on each floor for calling the elevator. An elevator will be chosen by how close the elevator is to the calling floor. If an idle elevator exists, prefer taking it over the busy elevators.

## Run it locally
